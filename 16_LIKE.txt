El operador LIKE por defecto es lo mismo que utilizar el operador igual(=)

2		Fuller		Andrew		1952-02-19	EmpID2.pic	Andrew received his BTS commercial and a Ph.D. in international marketing from the University of Dallas. He is fluent in French and Italian and reads German.

Lo que lo diferencia del operador igual es que posee dos "comodines" el % que señala que debe buscar
valores que contengan esa condicion sin contar lo que tenian por detras o por delante. en "%ler" le digo que me devuelva 
resultados que contengan "ler" sin importar si tenian mas texto "antes" de llegar a "ler".

SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE LastName like  "%ler"

Tambien puede funcionar al revez, puede señalar a un valor que empieze con una condicion y que termine 
con cualquier cosa, por ejemplo LIKE "f%"

SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE LastName like  "f%"

El operador LIKE no es key sensitive, osea, no diferencia mayusculas de minusculas.

Tambien podria utilizar el comodin % en ambos lados de la condicion para señalar a un valor que empieze y 
termine como quiera mientras contenga mi condicion, por ejemplo:

SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE LastName like  "%r%"

Basicamente el comodin % es para devolver un valor que comienze con algo "algo%", que termine con algo "%algo"
o que contenga algo "%algo%".



********************************************************
El segundo comodin es el guion bajo ("_") que nos dice que cierto valor contiene cierta cantidad de caracteres,
un guion representara la cantidad de caracteres, ejemplo:

SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE LastName like  "F___er" //son 3 guiones bajos para "ull" de "fuller"
